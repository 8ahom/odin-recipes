    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My mom made this broccoli cheese casserole every Thanksgiving when I was little. We kids could never get enough! If you have children or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee that they will eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish. It's also fabulous with a Christmas ham.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mushroom Soup</li>
        <li>Mayonaise</li>
